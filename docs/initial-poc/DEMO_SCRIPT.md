**Show:**
- Connection indicator
- Start Run button
- Real-time progress bar animation

- Pause/Resume/Cancel controls

---

### Part 3: Desktop Application (5 min)

**Action:**
1. Open desktop app from Finder
2. Show it connects to same backend
3. Click "Start Run" in desktop app
4. Show real-time updates

**Talking Points:**
- "Native macOS/Windows/Linux desktop app using Tauri 2"
- "Same React codebase, deployed as native application"
- "10MB app size vs 100MB+ with Electron"
- "Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff"
- "Can run offline with local backend"

**Show:**
- Desktop app window (1280x800, GenUI branding)
- Connection status
- Real-time updates working
- Stop backend → show reconnection attempts
- Restart backend → auto-reconnects

---

### Part 4: Architecture & Code Quality (5 min)

**Action:**
```bash
# Show project structure
tree -L 2 services/

# Show key files
cat services/frontend/src/services/websocket.ts  # Auto-reconnect logic
cat services/frontend/src/store/instrumentStore.ts  # State management
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Monorepo with npm workspaces"
- "React 19, Vite 7, TypeScript, TailwindCSS v4"
- "Node.js 24 LTS backend"
- "Zustand for state management"
- "WebSocket service with unlimited retry + exponential backoff"

**Show:**
- Project structure
- WebSocket auto-reconnect code
- Zustand store
- Type definitions

---

### Part 5: Developer Experience (4 min)

**Action:**
```bash
# Show available commands
npm run

# Show setup script
npm run setup
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Automated setup script checks dependencies"
- "Rust version management for desktop builds"
- "Platform-specific build options"
- "Docker for Linux builds (no Rust required)"
- "Comprehensive documentation"

**Show:**
- Root package.json scripts
- Setup script checking Rust
- Documentation structure
- Phase summaries

---

### Part 6: Deployment Options (3 min)

**Action:**
```bash
# Show build scripts
cat package.json | grep tauri
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Web deployment: Standard Docker containers"
- "Desktop deployment: Native apps for all platforms"
- "macOS: `npm run tauri:build:macos` (requires Rust)"
- "Linux: `npm run tauri:build:linux` (Docker, no Rust)"
- "CI/CD ready with GitHub Actions"

**Show:**
- Build scripts
- Built .app in Finder
- Dockerfile.tauri for Linux builds

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Docker-First**: Production-ready from day one
2. **Real-Time**: WebSocket communication with auto-reconnect
3. **Cross-Platform**: Web + Desktop (macOS/Windows/Linux)
4. **Modern Stack**: React 19, Vite 7, Tauri 2, Node 24 LTS
5. **Developer Experience**: One-command setup, comprehensive docs

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Backend not connecting
```bash
npm run docker:backend
# Wait for "WebSocket server listening on port 8080"
```

### Desktop app not connecting
1. Quit desktop app completely (Cmd+Q)
2. Ensure backend is running
3. Reopen desktop app

### Port conflicts
```bash
npm run docker:clean  # Stop and remove containers
npm start             # Restart fresh
```

## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

**Q: How hard is it to add new instrument types?**  
A: Very easy - just add new state constants and update the simulator phases.

**Q: Can this scale to multiple instruments?**  
A: Yes - backend is stateless, can run multiple instances behind load balancer.

**Q: What about security?**  
A: WebSocket can use WSS (TLS), authentication can be added via JWT tokens.

**Q: How do you handle disconnections?**  
A: Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (1s → 30s max), unlimited retries.

**Q: Why Tauri over Electron?**  
A: 10x smaller bundle size, better performance, native OS integration, Rust security.

**Q: Can we deploy this today?**  
A: Yes - Docker images ready, desktop apps built, just need deployment target.
